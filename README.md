Install Python 3 if you have not already. When you are ready run the following commands in the terminal at the root folder containing the project.

2. Run file: `python sqaure_detection.py`

If you want to explore the Jupyter Notebook (highly recommend you do) follow the steps below:

1. If you have note installed the packages already run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run this line in your terminal at the root folder: `jupyter notebook`. It will open up a window in your browser. Look for `square_detection.ipynb` file and click on it.
3. Run through the code...
